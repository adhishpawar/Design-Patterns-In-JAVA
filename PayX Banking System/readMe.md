# 🏦 **PayX Design Patterns Documentation**

PayX is a fully modular Java-based Banking & FinTech system designed using **Enterprise-Level Design Patterns**.  
Each design pattern solves a specific real-world problem found in banking systems such as RBI gateways, UPI stack, credit-card networks, and ledger engines.

This documentation explains **how each pattern is used**, **why it is required**, and **how PayX integrates all patterns into one unified architecture**.

---

# 🔥 **1. Singleton Pattern — Global Object Manager**

**Purpose:** Ensure only one instance exists for critical components.

### ✔ Why needed in PayX?

- Database connection pool

- Configuration loader

- Logger

- Cache manager


### ✔ What we implemented?

`SingletonRegistry` — stores and returns unique bean instances (Spring-like container).

### ✔ Real benefit:

All core PayX components share one instance → avoids conflict, improves performance.

---

# 🏭 **2. Factory / BeanFactory — Central Object Creation**

**Purpose:** Create objects without exposing construction logic.

### ✔ Why needed in PayX?

- To instantiate services without `new`

- To mimic `Spring BeanFactory`

- To allow easy swapping of implementations (Strategy, Proxy, Adapters)


### ✔ What we implemented?

`BeanFactory` that creates and stores beans dynamically.

### ✔ Real benefit:

PayX achieves **Inversion of Control** like Spring.  
Any service can be replaced without code changes (ex: switching Payment Strategies).

---

# 🎯 **3. Strategy Pattern — Swappable Payment Algorithms**

**Purpose:** Choose algorithm at runtime.

### ✔ Why needed in PayX?

Every payment method has different rules:

- UPI

- Card

- Wallet

- NetBanking


Each requires different:

- debit logic

- validation

- processing

- risk checks


### ✔ What we implemented?

`PaymentStrategy` + `PaymentStrategyFactory`

### ✔ Real benefit:

PayX can plug new payment method instantly (ex: adding EMI or Crypto).

---

# 👁️‍🗨️ **4. Observer Pattern — Notification System**

**Purpose:** Publish events to multiple listeners.

### ✔ Why needed in PayX?

When a payment succeeds, many subsystems must react:

- Email service

- SMS service

- Ledger posting

- Fraud monitor

- Notification service

- Analytics


### ✔ What we implemented?

`EventManager` + observers (`EmailObserver`, `LedgerObserver`, etc.)

### ✔ Real benefit:

Loose coupling → adding new listeners requires ZERO changes to payment code.

---

# 🔗 **5. Chain of Responsibility — Validation Pipeline**

**Purpose:** Step-by-step processing where each handler decides to continue or stop.

### ✔ Why needed in PayX?

Multiple validations:

- Check KYC

- Check daily limit

- Check fraud score

- Check balance

- Check UPI PIN validation

- Check card limit


### ✔ What we implemented?

`ValidationHandler` + multiple validation nodes.

### ✔ Real benefit:

You can add/remove/reorder validation logic without touching core code.

---

# 🧱 **6. Template Method — Standardized Payment Workflow**

**Purpose:** Define algorithm skeleton; allow subclasses to replace certain steps.

### ✔ Why needed in PayX?

All payment types follow SAME STEPS:

1. Validate customer

2. Validate balance

3. Debit

4. Record ledger

5. Send notification


Only the _debit_ + _balance check_ differ.

### ✔ What we implemented?

`PaymentTemplate` + `UpiPaymentFlow`, `CardPaymentFlow`, etc.

### ✔ Real benefit:

Ensures RBI compliance — nobody can change mandatory flow by mistake.

---

# 🔌 **7. Adapter Pattern — External Bank Integration**

**Purpose:** Convert incompatible APIs.

### ✔ Why needed in PayX?

External banks use different formats:

- paise instead of rupees

- different function names

- different field structure


### ✔ What we implemented?

`PayXBankAPI` (internal interface)  
`ExternalBankAdapter` converts → PayXFormat → ExternalFormat

### ✔ Real benefit:

PayX is NOT dependent on vendor API format.  
Changing bank vendor → ZERO code changes.

---

# 🧰 **8. Facade Pattern — One Unified PayX API**

**Purpose:** Simplify complex subsystem behind a single interface.

### ✔ Why needed in PayX?

Payment requires:

- Strategy

- Template Method

- Validation

- Notification

- Logging

- Fraud check

- Adapter integration

- Proxy access control


Complexity must NOT be exposed.

### ✔ What we implemented?

`PayXFacade` exposing:

`processPayment() transfer()`

### ✔ Real benefit:

Everything behind one simple API.  
Same concept used by SpringBoot → `SpringApplication.run()`.

---

# 🛡️ **9. Proxy Pattern — Add Cross-Cutting Concerns**

**Purpose:** Add security/logging/audit without touching business logic.

### ✔ Why needed in PayX?

Before calling payment logic we need:

- logging

- audit

- performance tracking

- rate limit

- security check

- fraud screen


### ✔ What we implemented?

`PaymentServiceProxy` wraps `PaymentService`.

### ✔ Real benefit:

No changes inside PaymentService — just wrap it with new cross-cutting behavior.

This is EXACTLY how Spring AOP works.

---

# 🧱 **10. Builder Pattern — Create Complex Request Objects**

**Purpose:** Build objects with many fields in a clean way.

### ✔ Why needed in PayX?

Requests contain many fields:

- account

- amount

- ip

- deviceId

- location

- currency

- channel

- metadata


### ✔ What we implemented?

`PaymentRequest.Builder`  
`FundTransferRequest.Builder`

### ✔ Real benefit:

Immutable, safe, readable, compatible with enterprise APIs.

# **Which patterns Spring secretly uses**

| Pattern                  | Spring Implementation                         | You normally don’t know it's happening   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Singleton                | `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`       | Spring makes _one instance_ per bean     |
| Factory / Factory Method | `BeanFactory`, `ApplicationContext`           | Spring creates objects for you           |
| Proxy                    | AOP, `@Transactional`, `@Cacheable`, `@Async` | Method interception                      |
| Template Method          | `JdbcTemplate`, `RestTemplate`                | Fixed process with customizable steps    |
| Observer                 | `ApplicationEventPublisher`, `@EventListener` | SOA event dispatching                    |
| Strategy                 | multiple beans of same interface              | dependency injection chooses correct one |

| Adapter                  | MVC argument resolvers & handler adapters     | Match methods to controllers             |
| Facade                   | Service layer                                 | hides complexity                         |
| Builder                  | Lombok `@Builder` or manual patterns          | Data objects & DTOs                      |
